## Audience
Our audience is owners of vehicles. For testing purposes, owning an Alexa isn’t a prerequisite though. 

Being that voice-based interfaces are such a new avenue we don’t have much to go off of for finding the characteristics of our target audience. Also the audience can vary widely in age as well as technological proficiency, among other things. 

It is important to note that the audience will include both french and english speakers. It is especially important to include both language speakers during testing.

Our audience also includes those with disabilities.

## Plan the test
Determine what success or failure is
We must determine what constitutes a passed or failed test? There are two cases that we determine is a pass.
The user is able to find recall information for their vehicle it is a pass. 
The user was able to determine that their vehicle does not have any recalls. 

In our case if the user passes the test, how they got to the pass is important as it can lead to an improved script.

A failure would be where someone thinks there isn't a recall when there is one. 

Get everything you need and do a test run
Alexa device
Wireless hotspot 
Audio recording device when testing non-visual interfaces
Video recording device when testing includes the visual interface on screened Alexa devices
Test script
Minimum 1 facilitator and 1 note taker

Once you have everything you need, perform a test run. Make sure the Alexa device is ready to go. Make sure the hotspot works. Ensure the recording device records. 

## Prepare the script
Ensure you have all of the documents you’ll need during the test. In most cases once you have created it, you can reuse the same documents in future testing. 
Since our Alexa skill is bilingual, ensure all documents are translated. 

## Recruit participants
There are various ways to recruit participants for user testing. 
Family and friends outside of work
Work colleagues
Call for participants through social media

We will require participants from both official languages. We also want to ensure that we test our skill with participants with disabilities.

## Run the test
It is important to run a test pilot before the scheduled session is to take place. This is to catch any problems before hand and to ensure the scheduled testing goes off without any issues.The pilot should be run a day or two beforehand to give time if any larger issues (equipment failures, etc.) need to be fixed. 

When running the test, ensure there is 1 moderator and 1 note taker. Ensure that the room is booked for longer than you need. Also it is a good idea to run multiple tests on the same day as you will have already set up the equipment. 

If there are problems during the testing, ensure to keep note of them and adjust for future testing.

## Conclusions and next steps
Using the notes created from the testing sessions, identify where users failed tasks. From this you will find improvements to the product as well as the test itself. These improvements will help in future rounds of testing. 

It is especially important to perform a technical evaluation of the results to ensure that the information given to participants is correct. An example that we want to avoid would be a situation where a user searches for a 2004 Honda Civic and Alexa returns recall information that includes all years of Honda Civics.
